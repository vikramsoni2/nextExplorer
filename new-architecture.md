Of course. Your project is at a critical inflection point where a well-planned architectural refactor is essential. Moving from a flat, type-based structure to a modular, feature-based architecture will solve your current scalability and management issues.

Here is a robust architectural design to guide your refactoring process.

-----

## Guiding Principles

Our new architecture will be guided by these core principles:

1.  **Modularity (Feature-Based):** Instead of organizing by file type (e.g., all components in one folder, all stores in another), we will organize by **feature**. All the code related to "Authentication" will live in one place, separate from "Sharing," and so on. This makes the codebase intuitive to navigate and allows teams to work on features in isolation.
2.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Within each feature, and across the application, we'll maintain a strict separation between UI (`components`), state management (`stores`), and logic (`composables`, `api`).
3.  **Scalability & Reusability:** We'll create a dedicated space for truly shared, reusable UI components and logic that can be used across any feature, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication. This is where Storybook will shine.

## Proposed Architecture: Feature-Sliced Design

We will adopt a structure inspired by **Feature-Sliced Design**. This pattern is perfect for complex applications like yours. It balances strict boundaries with pragmatic organization.

Hereâ€™s the target directory structure:

```diff
  src
  â”œâ”€â”€ App.vue
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
  â”‚
- â”œâ”€â”€ api

- â”œâ”€â”€ composables
- â”œâ”€â”€ config
- â”œâ”€â”€ icons
- â”œâ”€â”€ layouts
- â”œâ”€â”€ plugins
- â”œâ”€â”€ router
- â”œâ”€â”€ stores
- â”œâ”€â”€ utils
- â””â”€â”€ views

+ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginPage.vue
+ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FolderPage.vue
+ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SettingsPage.vue
+ â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”‚

+ â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stores          # Global stores (e.g., notifications, user profile)
  â”‚

## Detailed Breakdown & How It Solves Your Problems

### ðŸ“‚ `shared` - The Foundation

This is the lowest level of our architecture. Code here knows nothing about other layers. It's the toolbox for the rest of your app.

  * **`shared/components`:** This is where you'll build your **Storybook library**. Components like `ModalDialog.vue`, `Button.vue`, and `Input.vue` go here. They are "dumb" and receive all data and functions as props.
  * **`shared/api`:** We'll set up a central Axios (or other client) instance here. This is the **perfect place for robust error handling**. We'll use interceptors to automatically handle 401 (unauthorized) errors by redirecting to login, and to catch other errors, which can then be propagated to a global notification store in `shared/stores`.
  * **`shared/lib`:** Your current `utils` folder gets renamed to `lib` and moves here.

### âœ¨ `features` - The Core Functionality

This is where the magic happens. Each folder is a self-contained feature. Let's map your requirements:

  * **Username/Password/OIDC & Multi-User:**
      * Create a `src/features/auth` directory.
      * Inside, you'll have `components/` (e.g., `LoginForm.vue`, `OidcButton.vue`), its own `store/auth.store.js`, and its `api/auth.api.js` for login/logout endpoints.
  * **File/Folder Sharing & Expiring Links:**
      * Create `src/features/file-sharing`.
      * This will contain the UI components (`ShareModal.vue`, `PermissionSelector.vue`), the Pinia store to manage sharing state, and the API calls.
  * **Customizable Settings & Icon Packs:**
      * The `src/features/settings` folder will manage this.
      * **For Icon Packs:** The settings store (`features/settings/store/settings.store.js`) will hold the `currentIconPack`. Your `FileIcon.vue` (which should now live in `features/file-manager/components`) will use a dynamic component (`<component :is="iconComponent">`) that resolves the correct icon based on the file type and the selected pack. The icon sets themselves can live in `shared/assets/icons/{pack-name}/`.

### ðŸ§© `plugins` - Your Extensible Previewer/Editor

Your current `plugins` folder is a great start. Let's formalize it.

1.  **Plugin Registration:** Create a manager, perhaps in `features/previewer/manager.js`. This manager will have a `register(plugin)` function.
2.  **Plugin Structure:** Each plugin in the `src/plugins` directory will be a folder containing:
      * `index.js`: Exports a plugin object `{ name: 'PDF Viewer', supportedMimeTypes: ['application/pdf'], component: PdfPreviewComponent }`.
      * `Preview.vue`: The Vue component for the previewer.
3.  **Dynamic Loading:** The `PreviewHost.vue` (from your old structure, now living in `features/previewer/components`) will consult the `manager` to find the right plugin for a given file's MIME type and dynamically load its component.
4.  **Office Documents:** You can create a new plugin `src/plugins/office-docs`. Its `Preview.vue` component would contain the logic to integrate with an Open Office service like Collabora or OnlyOffice.

### ðŸ“„ `pages` - The Views

This layer, formerly `views`, composes features and shared components into what the user sees at a specific URL. For example, `pages/FolderPage.vue` would import and use components from `features/file-manager`, `features/file-sharing`, and `shared/components`.

### ðŸš€ `app` - The Entrypoint

This is the top level that wires everything together. It initializes the router, Pinia, and global styles. Your main `App.vue` and `layouts` live here.

## Step-by-Step Refactoring Plan

Don't try to refactor everything at once. Do it gradually.

1.  **Setup the New Structure:** Create the new folders: `app`, `features`, `pages`, and `shared`.
2.  **Move Shared Components:** Start by identifying purely presentational components (`ModalDialog`, etc.). Move them to `shared/components/ui` and create your first Storybook stories for them.
3.  **Migrate the API Layer:** Move your `api/index.js` to `shared/api/index.js`. Add a global error interceptor that logs errors or shows a toast message.
4.  **Tackle One Feature:** Pick one feature, like **authentication**.
      * Create `src/features/auth`.
      * Move `AuthLoginView.vue` to `src/pages/LoginPage.vue`.
      * Create a new `auth.store.js` inside `features/auth/store/`.
      * Create any components it needs inside `features/auth/components/`.
      * Update your router to point to the new `LoginPage.vue`.
5.  **Continue Feature by Feature:** Gradually migrate your existing code into the new feature-sliced structure. The core file browser will be your largest feature (`features/file-manager`).
6.  **Implement the Plugin System:** Refactor your existing `plugins` directory into the more formal structure described above, managed by a central `previewer` feature.

This architecture will provide you with a clear, scalable, and intuitive foundation to build upon. It will make onboarding new developers easier and will allow you to add complex features like split-view and robust sharing without turning your codebase into an unmanageable monolith.
