## Self-Host with Docker Compose

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker Engine 24+ and Docker Compose v2.
- Host directories that you want to expose to the explorer.
- A writable cache directory for generated thumbnails (recommended: SSD-backed storage).

### 2. Prepare host folders
Create or pick folders you plan to mount, for example:
- `/srv/nextexplorer/cache` for cached thumbnails and settings.
- `/srv/data/Projects` and `/srv/data/Downloads` for content you want to browse.
Ensure the Docker user has read/write permissions to each directory.

### 3. Compose file
Create `docker-compose.yml` alongside your other infrastructure files:

```yaml
services:
  nextexplorer:
    image: nxzai/explorer:latest
    container_name: nextexplorer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # host:container
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      # Optional: match the container user/group to your host IDs
      # - PUID=1000
      # - PGID=1000
    volumes:
      - /srv/nextexplorer/cache:/cache
      - /srv/data/Projects:/mnt/Projects
      - /srv/data/Downloads:/mnt/Downloads
```

Every folder you mount under `/mnt` becomes a top-level volume inside the app. Add as many as you need by repeating the `/path/on/host:/mnt/Label` pattern.

### 4. Launch
Run the stack from the directory containing your Compose file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The API and UI are both served on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Map container user IDs (recommended)
1. On the host, run `id -u` and `id -g` to capture your user and group IDs.
2. Set the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables in your Compose file so the container runs as your user.
3. Restart the stack; any files created through nextExplorer will now be owned by your user on the host.

### 6. First-run setup
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Set a password when prompted; this gate protects all future sessions.
3. Browse the Volumes panel to verify each mount shows up as expected.
4. Start uploading or editing files—thumbnails will populate the cache automatically.

### 7. Updating
To pull the latest release:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The container persists user settings in `/cache` and never touches the contents of your mounted volumes unless you explicitly upload, move, or delete items through the UI.

## Running Behind a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx Proxy Manager)

When placing nextExplorer behind a reverse proxy and a custom domain, set a single environment variable and the app will derive everything it needs:

- `PUBLIC_URL` – the fully-qualified public URL for your app (no trailing slash). Example: `https://files.example.com`

What it controls:
- CORS allowed origin defaults to the origin of `PUBLIC_URL` unless you explicitly set `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- OIDC callback URL defaults to `PUBLIC_URL + /api/auth/oidc/callback` unless you explicitly set `OIDC_CALLBACK_URL`.
- Express automatically enables `trust proxy` when `PUBLIC_URL` is provided (can be overridden with `TRUST_PROXY`).

Compose example:

```yaml
services:
  nextexplorer:
    image: nxzai/explorer:latest
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PUBLIC_URL=https://files.example.com
      # Optional: override or add more CORS origins
      # - CORS_ORIGINS=https://files.example.com,https://admin.example.com
      # Optional: override OIDC callback if you need a non-default path
      # - OIDC_CALLBACK_URL=https://files.example.com/custom/callback
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # or run without publishing and let the proxy connect the container network
```

Nginx Proxy Manager tips:
- Point your domain to the container’s internal port 3000.
- Enable Websockets and preserve `X-Forwarded-*` headers (enabled by default in NPM).
- Terminate TLS at the proxy; nextExplorer will treat cookies as Secure in production.

## OIDC (OpenID Connect) Authentication

nextExplorer supports OIDC providers such as Authentik, Keycloak, Google, and others via a generic, provider‑agnostic setup.

### Environment variables
- `OIDC_ENABLED`: `true|false` to enable OIDC.
- `OIDC_ISSUER`: Provider issuer URL (used for discovery). Example: `https://id.example.com/application/o/your-app/`.
- `OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL`, `OIDC_TOKEN_URL`, `OIDC_USERINFO_URL` (optional): Manually override endpoints. If omitted, discovery is used from `OIDC_ISSUER`.
- `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`: Credentials for your app.
- `OIDC_CALLBACK_URL` (optional): Callback URL. If not set, derived from `PUBLIC_URL` as `${PUBLIC_URL}/api/auth/oidc/callback`.
- `OIDC_SCOPES` (optional): Space/comma separated scopes. Default: `openid profile email`. Add `groups` if your provider exposes it.
- `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` (recommended): Space/comma separated group names that should map to the app’s `admin` role, e.g. `next-admin admins`.

Notes:
- Discovery: If `OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL`/`OIDC_TOKEN_URL`/`OIDC_USERINFO_URL` are not supplied, the app fetches them from `OIDC_ISSUER/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- Callback: If you run behind a reverse proxy, set `PUBLIC_URL` so the default callback is correct.

### Admin role mapping
- Provider‑agnostic: The app only looks at standard OIDC claims for group‑like values: `groups`, `roles`, `entitlements` (arrays or space/comma strings).
- Config‑driven: A user becomes `admin` only if they belong to any group listed in `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` (case‑insensitive). Otherwise the user gets role `user`.
- No implicit defaults: There are no built‑in admin group names. If `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` is empty/unset, no OIDC user is auto‑elevated.
- Safety: If an existing user already has the `admin` role, the app preserves it on subsequent logins to avoid accidental demotion.

Example compose snippet:

```yaml
services:
  nextexplorer:
    image: nxzai/explorer:latest
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_URL=https://files.example.com
      - OIDC_ENABLED=true
      - OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com/application/o/next/
      # Optional manual overrides (otherwise discovery is used)
      # - OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL=...
      # - OIDC_TOKEN_URL=...
      # - OIDC_USERINFO_URL=...
      - OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
      - OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
      - OIDC_SCOPES=openid profile email groups
      - OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS=next-admin admins
```

Provider tips:
- Authentik/Keycloak: Usually expose `groups`; include `groups` in scopes.
- Google: Group claims typically require additional configuration (Cloud Identity / Admin SDK). Without groups, users will be `user` role by default.
