## Highlights

- Added OIDC-powered multi-user support plus a configurable `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` mapping so IdP users can become admins when necessary.
- Introduced the new sidebar user menu and tooltips on toolbar icons to keep key actions within reach.
- Added `PUBLIC_URL` awareness for reverse proxies and paved the way for future sharing controls.
- Sidebar resizing, responsive breadcrumbs, and flexible view modes keep the desktop-like experience consistent across screen sizes.
- Enabled ripgrep-backed search for filenames and content inside files, plus right-click context menus for file creation, copying, moving, and metadata actions.
- Bundled a built-in editor with syntax highlighting and kept uploads/downloads accessible via drag-and-drop, floating progress panels, and batch downloads.
- Fresh “New Folder” support surfaced directly in the context menu to speed up directory creation.
